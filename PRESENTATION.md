# 360Nurse Healthcare Platform

## Project Overview

360Nurse is a nurse-led remote patient monitoring platform designed to deliver quality healthcare in underserved regions. This demonstration showcases the core functionalities of the platform, focusing on how it enables remote patient monitoring, emergency response, and healthcare management.

## Key Features

### 1. Remote Patient Monitoring
- Real-time tracking of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, oxygen levels)
- Automatic alerts when vitals breach predefined thresholds
- Historical data visualization with interactive charts

### 2. Emergency Alert System
- One-click emergency assistance requests
- Alert status tracking (Pending, Acknowledged, Dispatched, Resolved)
- Notification system for healthcare providers

### 3. Role-Based Access
- **Patient Portal**: View vital signs, manage alerts, request assistance
- **Nurse Dashboard**: Monitor assigned patients, respond to alerts
- **Facility Admin Console**: Manage healthcare staff and patients

## Technology Stack

- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **Deployment**: Render

## Demo Accounts

For demonstration purposes, the following accounts are available:

- **Patient**: patient@example.com / patient123
- **Nurse**: nurse@example.com / nurse123
- **Facility Admin**: facilityadmin@example.com / facilityadmin123

## Project Scope

This project is a school demonstration and does not include:
- Actual integration with wearable devices
- Real emergency service connections
- Production-level security measures

The vital signs and alerts are simulated for demonstration purposes.

## Future Enhancements

In a real-world implementation, the platform would include:
- Integration with medical wearables
- GPS-driven emergency dispatch
- Telemedicine capabilities
- Advanced data analytics for predictive healthcare
- Mobile applications for patients and healthcare providers

## Acknowledgements
